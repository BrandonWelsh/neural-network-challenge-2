## Program Goals
"You are tasked with creating a neural network that HR can use to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company. Additionally, HR believes that some employees may be better suited to other departments, so you are also asked to predict the department that best fits each employee. These two columns should be predicted using a branched neural network."

## Dependencies
pandas, tensorflow, sklearn, numpy

## Setup Instructions
Run pip install pandas, tensorflow, numpy, and sklearn before running program (if you do not already have these libraries).

Next, run the following:

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras import layers

## How to use
Run each jupyter notebook cell. That's pretty much it.
